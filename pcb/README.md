**The MK14keyscp pcb**

This folder contains the details and kicad files for the mk14keyscp pcb that can be used to use either an arduino or a ESP8266 development board to "press" the keys on a Science of Cambridge MK14 computer.

The main purpose of this board is to load programs into the small memory of the MK14 by using the keypad.

There are pdf and png images of the board plus the zipped kicad and gerber files.

* *note* The version of kicad changed during the creation of this pcb so there are some "rescue" files in the kicad folder which I'm not sure if they are needed as some of the footprints etc., are from the earlier libraries.

Mod 1 schema - shows the addition of 2 leds to provide basic status information on the wifi, whether it has connected to the wifi or had created a Wireless Access Point (WAP). 

Hope this is of some use. \
Enjoy and stay safe
